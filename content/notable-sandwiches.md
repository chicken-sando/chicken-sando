# Dave's Hot Chicken - Los Angeles, CA

Some of my best friends -- Rex and Emily -- took me to Dave's Hot Chicken in
Los Angeles. I was skeptical when they said it was the best sandwich they had
had. This sando really packed a punch with the perfect blend of heat, spices
and sauce. The kale slaw provided a cool contrast to the hot patty and added
to the already excellent crunch of this sandwich. This sandwich was truly
incredible.

Score: 8.9

# Square 5 Public House - Blacksburg, VA

This chicken sandwich was practically perfect. It was served hot, open and
incredibly crispy. The honey mustard was a perfect compliment to the to the
salty and spicy seasoning of the cutlet. This sandwich succeeded in providing
the elusive "center crunch," that so many other sandwiches fail to deliver.

Score: 9.0

# El Ranchero - Blacksburg, VA

I was convinced to order a chicken sandwich from "El Ranchero" in blacksburg.
Honestly, this is the worst piece of food I have ever eaten. I couldn't tell if
the patty had sat in the freezer for more than a year or if it had sat in the
frier for the same amount of time. The patty literally stopped my front two
teeth as I tried to bite it. I had to masticate quite vigorously to break this
patty and as I did it turned into the equivalent of chicken sawdust in my
mouth. The only saving grace of this sandwich was the "white sauce" which
although too sweet for my tastebuds was a welcome respite from the absolute
piece of trash that was this sandwich.

Score: 1.8
